                            Starting end november, 777Tourneys will begin to organize a league for Call of Duty Cold War. There will be 3-4 leagues every year, depending on the team's idea's and wishes.<br><br>
                            The tournament will be a 16 teams(if more teams, there will be a A and a B league with 1 final). The teams will battle it out across a 10 week weekly tournament program.<br>
                            Every week there will be a elimination bracket,  to gain points for the overall rankings.<br><br>
                            At the end of the league, the team with the lowest overall score will win the league.<br><br>
                            What is the vision for the league for the 777 League? The main goal is to invest in the grow of the 777 League, to get a 4-division league with a promotion and degradation system.<br>
                            In this process where we would like to go, our importance goes to the growth of our teams and organizations as well to get to a higher level together!<br><br>
